    question: "Why should I hire you?",
    answer:
      "You should hire me because I bring a mix of strong technical and soft skills. I stay up to date with modern tech stacks and not only build applications but also know how to deploy and maintain them. Iâ€™m highly adaptable and a quick learner, which is essential in todayâ€™s fast-changing, AI-driven landscape. Beyond technology, I believe soft skills like communication, collaboration, and ownership are just as important â€” and Iâ€™ve developed the ability to use them effectively in team environments to drive results. Wanna chat about that, let's connect then.",

    question: "What makes you different from other candidates?",
    answer:
      "What makes me different is that I focus on being a strong engineer, not just a coder. Many people can write code, but I bring the ability to communicate effectively across teams â€” whether itâ€™s business analysts, project owners, managers, or junior developers. This allows me to align technical solutions with business needs. I prioritize building quality, reliable products within deadlines rather than rushing, which ensures long-term value for both the team and the business. I have some examples but hey if I tell you everything here then what we should talk about in interview.",

    question: "What are your career goals??",
    answer:
      "My career goal is simple: to keep learning and growing as an engineer. I strongly believe that success naturally follows continuous learning. In the short term, I want to deepen my expertise in DevOps, since itâ€™s such a vast field, and also explore how AI can enhance productivity in engineering. In the long term, I see myself taking on more ownership â€” leading projects, mentoring others, and building solutions that create real impact.",

    id: 4,
    question: "What motivates you to do your best work?",
    answer:
      " What motivates me most is the eagerness to see the real impact of my work â€” knowing that something I built is being used and making a difference. Iâ€™m also highly motivated when working with smart and passionate teammates, because it pushes me to raise my own bar and keep improving. And yes, fair rewards and recognition also play a role, because they reflect the value of the work I deliver.",
